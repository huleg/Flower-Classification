\chapter{Classification}

\section{Overview of classification pipeline}
Photo of a flower is taken by the user. CNN converts the photo into a characteristic vector. SVM classifiers used to determine the species of flower. 

\section{Convolutional neural network}
Used to generate characteristic vector from an image. Treated as a black box in this project.

\subsubsection{Sampling (Jittering?)}

\subsection{How SVMs are used in the classification pipeline}

\section{MatLab classification script}

\subsection{Explication of classification script}
Script uses the CNN to generate a characteristic vector from an inputted photo. We test that vector against the 102 weight vectors found during training to produce a classification prediction.





\chapter{Client architecture}


\section{Overview of client architecture}
Android application consists of three activities, or screens with which the user interacts. The Main Activity allows the user to take a photo or choose a photo from gallery to upload. The photo is uploaded to the server, which classifies the flower, and returns the result to the Results Activity. The results activity displays the eight top classification results, and allows the user to click on each, and find out more information in the Detail Activity. 

\section{Main Activity}

Main Activity consists of two buttons, which launch the camera and gallery image picker respectively.

\subsection{Uploading the photo}

\subsubsection{AsyncTask (keeping slow processes such as web connections off the UI thread)}

\subsubsection{Connecting to the server}

\subsection{Loading classification results}

\subsubsection{Parsing JSON Array}
